Crystals


Click the Crystals to have a random number generated for each guess.  Each guess will be added together and then compared to a random number chosen.  The goal is to match your amount to the random number chosen to win. If your guesses exceed the number chosen you lose. 

The games resets and a new random number is chosen.
